00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
 You look sensational, man.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 You look great.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
 It's very dynamic.

 Do you want an Oscar?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
 All right.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
 All right.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
