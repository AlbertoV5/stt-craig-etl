1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Man, it's crazy out there.

2
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:07.000
You look sensational, man.

3
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:08.000
Well, that's correct.

4
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:10.000
And that's not just the cold medication talking.

5
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:11.000
I'm telling you.

6
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:12.000
You look great.

7
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:13.000
You got the beard going on.

8
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:14.000
It's very dynamic.

9
0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:16.000
Oh, thank you very much.

10
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:17.000
No, it's good.

11
0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:18.000
You like Robin Williams?

12
0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:19.000
You grow a beard.

13
0:00:19.000 --> 0:00:20.000
Do you want an Oscar?

14
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:21.000
No.

15
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:22.000
All right.

16
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:23.000
All right.

17
0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:28.000
So listen, tell me about the side-by-side movie you were interviewing.

18
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:31.000
Is he really as much of a douche as everyone says he is?
